Final Project for Solar Panels
Data is downloaded from https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/ and then using the POWER Global Download Button to download the data. The data is too large to put in my github repository FYI

The parameters used were diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface and direct normal radiation

Data is the 30 year monthly and annual Solar Radiation from NASAâ€™s Langley Research Center with 0.5 degree resolution for latitude and longitude
